	- Fix for test failures on OSes with extended /etc/passwd format (RT #129146)

0.11  2006-07-09

Bug fixes in the handling of inherited classes, particularly those
with nonstandard field separators.

0.10  2006-07-06

Rewrote internals; the module now uses Tie::File for I/O, instead of
doing all the I/O manually.  This changed some behavior, but it will
be much easier to move forward.  A number of insoluble problems are
now wither solved or solvable.  In particular, you no longer need to
call ->flush explicitly; it is invoked automatically when the database
object is finished.

0.03  2006-07-06

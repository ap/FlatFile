FlatFile version 0.10
=====================

Functions for simple, lightweight management of flat-file databases


CHANGES FROM 0.04 -> 0.10:

Rewrote internals; the module now uses Tie::File for I/O, instead of
doing all the I/O manually.  This changed some behavior, but it will
be much easier to move forward.  A number of insoluble problems are
now wither solved or solvable.  In particular, you no longer need to
call ->flush explicitly; it is invoked automatically when the database
object is finished.

INSTALLATION
